# PROJECT NAME HERE

### Sustems

Ivan Gontchar, Elias Xu, Ishaana Misra

### Project Description:

We are going to simulate a chat app. Users will be able to type and read messages in different channels, which can be read by other users in those channels.

### Instructions:

How does the user install/compile/run the program?
- In the repo, any user should run the command "make compile".
- After this, the first user should run the command "./serv", which will launch the server end of the program.
 - Subsequent users who are running the program in other terminals should run the command "./cli" which will launch the client end of the program.
- This will cause the app to launch in the terminal, and thus the user should follow on-screen prompts.

How does the user interact with this program?
